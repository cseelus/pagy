# Array

This extra adds a specialized pagination for arrays without the need to override the `pagy_get_items` in your controller, and without the need to use any expensive array-wrapping or patching.

That means that you can paginate the array independently from any other kind of collections you may need to paginate even in the same action.

## Synopsys

See [extras](../extras.md) for general usage info.

In a controller:

```ruby
@pagy_a, @items   = pagy_array(an_array, ...)

# independently paginate some other collections as usual
@pagy_b, @records = pagy(some_scope, ...)
```

## Files

This extra is composed of 1 file:

- [array.rb](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/lib/pagy/extras/array.rb)

## Methods

This extra adds the `pagy_array` method to the `Pagy::Backend` to be used in place (or in parallel) of the `pagy` method when you have to paginate an array. It also adds a `pagy_array_get_variables` sub-method, used for easy customization of variables by overriding.

__Notice__: there is no `pagy_array_get_items` method to override, since the items are fetched directly by the specialized `pagy_array` method.

### pagy_array(array, vars=nil)

This method is the same as the generic `pagy` method, but specialized for an Array. (see the [pagy doc](../api/backend.md#pagycollection-varsnil))

### pagy_array_get_vars(array)

This sub-method is the same as the `pagy_get_vars` sub-method, but it is called only by the `pagy_array` nethod. (see the [pagy_get_vars doc](../api/backend.md#pagy_get_varscollection))
